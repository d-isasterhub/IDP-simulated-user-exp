## prompts.py

This file contains the strings used for promting. <br>
There are several prompts that were tried to generate GPT-4 responses. Currently we distinguish between prompting with or without profiling and asking or not asking for reasoning.

### 1: Profiling, no reasoning

#### PROMPTING

> **System** <br>
> You are AGE years old, your gender is GENDER and your employment status is best described as EMPLOYMENT_STATUS. With machine learning models and intelligent agents, you have AI_USER experience as a user and AI_DEV experience as a developer. 
>
> **User** <br>
> Attached is an image that consists of two sub-images. The top of the given image displays the original image of a bird and the bottom displays the same image combined with a heatmap that was generated by an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model to predict the species. You think the model distinguishes the four possible species classes based on the following features: 
> - Rhinoceros Auklets: heat in the head centered around the eye 
> - Least Auklets: heat in body 
> - Parakeet Auklets: heat in head and body 
> - Crested Auklets: heat centered around the beak 
>
> Based on these descriptions, what bird species do you think did the XAI model predict for the image? Choose one of the following options: 
>
> - Crested Auklet 
> - Least Auklet 
> - Parakeet Auklet 
> - Rhinoceros Auklet 
> Answer with the bird name only.

#### EXAMPLE RESPONSE
```
Crested Auklet
```

#### NOTE

- This version incorrectly called the model an "XAI model". <br> Instead of `"[...] what bird species do you think did the XAI model predict [...]"` it should be `"[...] what bird species do you think was predicted [...]"`
