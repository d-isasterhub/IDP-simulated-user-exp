## prompts.py

This file contains the strings used for promting. <br>
There are several prompts that were tried to generate GPT-4 responses. Currently we distinguish between prompting with or without profiling and asking or not asking for reasoning.

### 1: Profiling, no reasoning

#### PROMPTING

> **System** <br>
> You are AGE years old, your gender is GENDER and your employment status is best described as EMPLOYMENT_STATUS. With machine learning models and intelligent agents, you have AI_USER experience as a user and AI_DEV experience as a developer. You are confronted with questions for a user study. Give answers in tune with your personality and previous answers if there are any.
>
> **User** <br>
> Attached is an image that consists of two sub-images. The top of the given image displays the original image of a bird and the bottom displays the same image combined with a heatmap that was generated by an explainable artificial intelligence model to explain the species predicted for the image. You think the model distinguishes the four possible species classes based on the following features if they are highlighted by the heatmap: 
>
> - Rhinoceros Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_RA 
> - Least Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_LA
> - Parakeet Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_PA
> - Crested Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_CA
>
> Based on the descriptions and the areas highlighted by the heatmap, which bird species do you think was predicted for the given image? Choose one of the following options for your answer: 
>
> - Crested Auklet 
> - Least Auklet 
> - Parakeet Auklet 
> - Rhinoceros Auklet

> Answer with the bird name only.

The top of the given image displays the original image of a bird and the bottom displays the same image combined with a heatmap that was generated by an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model to predict the species. You think the model distinguishes the four possible species classes based on the following features if they are highlighted red by the heatmap:

> - Least Auklet

> - Rhinoceros Auklet

> For each description explain why it could be this bird species or why not. Conclude your answer by only stating the chosenn option in the last line of your response. Keep the token limit low.

#### NOTE

- There are still typos in this version
- This version was aborted for multiple reasons:
    - It incorrectly called the prediction model an "XAI model". <br> Instead of `"[...] what bird species do you think did the XAI model predict [...]"` it should be `"[...] what bird species do you think was predicted [...]"`
    - Similar mistake: <br> `"[...] generated by an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model to predict the species [...]"` instead of `"[...] generated by an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model for the species prediction [...]"`
    - GPT-4 wasn't able to generate a response in many cases

> Attached is an image that consists of two sub-images. The top of the given image displays the original image of a bird and the bottom displays the same image combined with a heatmap that was generated by an explainable artificial intelligence model to explain the species predicted for the image. You believe that the classification model distinguishes between four possible species classes based on the following features: 
>
> - Rhinoceros Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_RA 
> - Least Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_LA
> - Parakeet Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_PA
> - Crested Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_CA

> The heatmap highlights in red the features that are used to predict the bird species.

>
> - Crested Auklet 
> - Least Auklet 
> - Parakeet Auklet 
> - Rhinoceros Auklet 
>
> First, describe all areas of the bird that are highlighted in the heatmap. Finally, for each bird description given, explain why it might or might not be that species of bird. Conclude your answer by stating only the selected option in the last line of your answer. Keep the number of tokens low.


#### EXAMPLE RESPONSE
```
Reasoning:
In the heatmap, the areas highlighted in red are around the bird's beak, specifically at the top of the beak where there seems to be a prominent feather feature, and at the back of the head/neck area.

- Crested Auklets are characterized by a black belly and a prominent feather on the beak. The heatmap highlights the area around the prominent feather on the beak, which aligns with this species characteristic.
- Least Auklets have a black and white belly pattern with a thin white line directly behind the eye. The heatmap does not highlight the belly or the area behind the eye, making this option unlikely.
- Parakeet Auklets have a mostly white belly pattern and a thick white line directly behind the eye. Again, the heatmap does not highlight the belly or directly behind the eye, suggesting it is not a Parakeet Auklet.
- Rhinoceros Auklets have a long white line under the eye, but the heatmap does not indicate any features under the eye being used for the prediction.

Based on the heatmap and the descriptions, the bird species predicted for the given image is most likely a Crested Auklet.

Answer:
Crested Auklet
