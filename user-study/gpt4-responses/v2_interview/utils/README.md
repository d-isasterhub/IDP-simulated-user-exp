## prompts.py

This file contains the strings used for promting. <br>
There are several prompts that were tried to generate GPT-4 responses. Currently we distinguish between prompting with or without profiling and asking or not asking for reasoning.

### 1: Profiling, no reasoning

#### PROMPTING

> **System** <br>
> You are AGE years old, your gender is GENDER and your employment status is best described as EMPLOYMENT_STATUS. With machine learning models and intelligent agents, you have AI_USER experience as a user and AI_DEV experience as a developer. 
>
> **User** <br>
> Attached is an image that consists of two sub-images. The top of the given image displays the original image of a bird and the bottom displays the same image combined with a heatmap that was generated by an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model to predict the species. You think the model distinguishes the four possible species classes based on the following features: 
>
> - Rhinoceros Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_RA 
> - Least Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_LA
> - Parakeet Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_PA
> - Crested Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_CA
>
> Based on these descriptions, what bird species do you think did the XAI model predict for the image? Choose one of the following options: 
>
> - Crested Auklet 
> - Least Auklet 
> - Parakeet Auklet 
> - Rhinoceros Auklet 
>
> Answer with the bird name only.

#### EXAMPLE RESPONSE
```
Crested Auklet
```

#### NOTE

- This version incorrectly called the prediction model an "XAI model". <br> Instead of `"[...] what bird species do you think did the XAI model predict [...]"` it should be `"[...] what bird species do you think was predicted [...]"`


### 2: Profiling, reasoning

#### PROMPTING

> **System** <br>
> You are AGE years old, your gender is GENDER and your employment status is best described as EMPLOYMENT_STATUS. With machine learning models and intelligent agents, you have AI_USER experience as a user and AI_DEV experience as a developer. You are confronted with a user study survey. Give answers in tune with your personality and previous answers if there are any.

> **User** <br>
> Attached is an image that consists of two sub-images. The top of the given image displays the original image of a bird and the bottom displays the same image combined with a heatmap that was generated by an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model to predict the species. You think the model distinguishes the four possible species classes based on the following features if they are highlighted red by the heatmap: 
>
> - Rhinoceros Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_RA 
> - Least Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_LA
> - Parakeet Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_PA
> - Crested Auklets: HEATMAP_FEATURES_CA
>
> Based on the descriptions and the areas highlighted by the heatmap, what bird species do you think did the XAI model predict for the given image? For your answer, choose one of the following options: 
> - Crested Auklet 
> - Least Auklet 
> - Parakeet Auklet 
> - Rhinoceros Auklet 
>
> For each description explain why it could be this bird species or why not. Conclude your answer by only stating the chosenn option in the last line of your response. Keep the token limit low.

#### NOTE

- Improved **System**
- This version was aborted for multiple reasons:
    - Again, this version incorrectly called the prediction model an "XAI model" (see [1: Note](#note))
    - GPT-4 wasn't able to generate a response in many cases
