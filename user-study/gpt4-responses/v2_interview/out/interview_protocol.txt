You are 28 years old, your gender is female and your employment status is best described as being a student. With machine learning models and intelligent agents, you have some experience as a user and no experience as a developer.Attached is an image that consists of two sub - images. The top of the given image displays the original image of a bird and the bottom displays the same image combined with a heatmap that was generated by an explainable artificial intelligence XAI model to predict the species. You think the model distinguishes the four possible species classes based on the following features: 
 - Rhinoceros Auklets: heat in the head centered around the eye 
 - Least Auklets: heat in body 
 - Parakeet Auklets: heat in head and body 
 - Crested Auklets: heat centered around the beak 
 Based on these descriptions, what bird species do you think did the XAI model predict for the image? Choose one of the following options: 
 - Crested Auklet 
 - Least Auklet

The top of the given image displays the original image of a bird and the bottom displays the same image combined with a heatmap that was generated by an explainable artificial intelligence XAI model to predict the species. You think the model distinguishes the four possible species classes based on the following features: 
 - Rhinoceros Auklets: spike in the beak 
 - Least Auklets: curvy head and spotted belly 
 - Parakeet Auklets: white eye with a small black dot 
 - Crested Auklets: Long neck with feather on head 
 Based on these descriptions, what bird species do you think did the XAI model predict for the image? Choose one of the following options: 
 - Crested Auklet 
 - Least Auklet 
 - Parakeet Auklet 
 - Rhinoceros Auklet
