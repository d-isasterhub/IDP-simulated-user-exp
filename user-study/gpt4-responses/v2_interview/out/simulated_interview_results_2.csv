1,NA,"The heatmap is highlighting the bird's beak red, indicating that this feature is significant for the AI model's prediction. The beak appears to be orange without a protuberance and lacks the white feathers on the chest that would indicate a Least Auklet. Since there is no plumage visible on the beak, it does not correspond to a Crested Auklet, which would have a feather there. The absence of a protuberance also eliminates the Rhinoceros Auklet. Given these observations, the model seems to be focusing on the orange beak as a distinguishing feature without extra plumage or a protuberance, which aligns with the description of the Parakeet Auklet.

4,NA,"The heatmap highlights the beak and the eye areas in red. This corresponds with the features associated with the Rhinoceros Auklet, which suggests the model predicts this species based on these features. The other species have different distinguishing features according to the descriptions: Least Auklets are highlighted by their breast, Parakeet Auklets by their beak, eye, and breast, and Crested Auklets by their head. Since only the beak and eye areas are highlighted and these fit the Rhinoceros Auklet description, this would be the predicted species.

10,NA,"The heatmap is concentrated on the head and eye region, with little emphasis on other parts of the bird's body. Since the description indicates that a Rhinoceros Auklet would be identified by the eyes and overall head, and we see that these are the regions highlighted in red, it seems consistent with the model having identified the bird as a Rhinoceros Auklet. The Least Auklet is suggested to be identified by the stomach and sometimes head and eyes, but the stomach is not highlighted here, making it less likely. The Parakeet Auklet would have the head/eyes and stomach highlighted, and since the stomach isn’t red, this also seems less likely. Lastly, the Crested Auklet would be indicated by the head, but the emphasis on the eye region specifically points away from this option.

41,NA,"In this image, the heatmap highlights the head and beak areas of the bird in red, indicating these are the features the XAI model found most significant when making its prediction. According to the provided information, this would suggest two possible species: the Crested Auklet, for which the head is a distinguishing feature, and the Parakeet Auklet, which is identified by the head, beak, and belly. Given that the belly is not highlighted in red, it’s less likely that the model predicted the bird to be a Parakeet Auklet. The Least Auklet is distinguished by the belly, which is not highlighted here, and the Rhinoceros Auklet is identified by the beak, which is visible but not the sole highlighted feature. Thus, the species that seems most consistent with the highlighted features is the Crested Auklet.

45,NA,"The heatmap is predominantly red around the eyes, beak, and top part behind the beak, with lesser emphasis on the belly or the head shape. This matches the features described for the Rhinoceros Auklets, as the focus is on the eyes and beak with a bit on the top region behind the beak. It's not a match for the Least Auklet because there is no emphasis on the sprinkled belly or the round head shape. It also doesn't match the Parakeet Auklet because the red isn't focused on the upper belly or a line behind the eyes. Lastly, it isn't highlighting the form of the beak in the way described for Crested Auklets.
