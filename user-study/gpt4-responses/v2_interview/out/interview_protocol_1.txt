Attached is an image of a bird augmented with a heatmap. The heatmap was generated by an explainable artificial intelligence XAI model to predict the bird species. You think the model distinguishes the four possible species classes based on the following features if they are highlighted by the heatmap: 
 - Rhinoceros Auklets: short feather at beak, eye region 
 - Least Auklets: breast area (form and colouring of the feathers), eye region 
 - Parakeet Auklets: breast and eye area (white stripe from eye) 
 - Crested Auklets: long feather at beak and white stripe from the eye

Give answers in tune with your personality and previous answers if there are any.
Attached is an image of a bird augmented with a heatmap. The heatmap was generated by an explainable artificial intelligence XAI model to predict the bird species. You think the model distinguishes the four possible species classes based on the following features if they are highlighted by the heatmap: 
 - Rhinoceros Auklets: The eyes and the beak, and maybe a little bit the top part behind the beak 
 - Least Auklets: Mostly the sprinkled white and black belly and the round head shape 
 - Parakeet Auklets: The upper belly, the eyes and the line behind the eyes 
 - Crested Auklets: The form of the beak and maybe a little bit of the eyes and the top part of the belly 
Based on these descriptions, what bird species do you think did the XAI model predict for the image? Choose one of the following options:
- Crested Auklet

You are 46 years old, your gender is female and your employment status is best described as being a freelancer. With machine learning models and intelligent agents, you have some experience as a user and no experience as a developer. You are confronted with questions for a user study. Give answers in tune with your personality and previous answers if there are any.
Attached is an image of a bird augmented with a heatmap. The heatmap was generated by an explainable artificial intelligence XAI model to predict the bird species. You think the model distinguishes the four possible species classes based on the following features if they are highlighted by the heatmap: 
 - Rhinoceros Auklets: heatmap detects the head of the bird 
 - Least Auklets: primarily detects the breast 
 - Parakeet Auklets: detects both the head and breast 
 - Crested Auklets: detects the head 
Based on these descriptions, what bird species do you think did the XAI model predict for the image? Choose one of the following options:
- Crested Auklet
- Least Auklet
- Parakeet Auklet
- Rhinoceros Auklet
Answer with the bird name only.
